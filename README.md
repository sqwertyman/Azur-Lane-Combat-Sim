# Azur Lane - Combat Simulator
 
The Azur Lane Combat Simulator (ALCS) is a game/tool I've been working on as coding practice. It is based off of Shanghai Manjuu and Xiamen Yongshi's game <i>Azur Lane</i> (hence the name), but I am intending to mostly strip the game down to it's core basics, leaving out the progression aspects, in order to allow the player to test in game setups they otherwise would'nt be able to.

This project uses Unity and C#, as they are the engine and coding language I am most comfortable with at the moment, even though Unity is a bit overkill for a relatively simple 2D game like this. A lot of new concepts and techniques are cropping up as I work through this, so even in it's current early stages, ALCS has been a great learning opportunity.
